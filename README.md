Project Description:
The objective of this project is to leverage machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of individuals receiving the XYZ and seasonal flu vaccines. By analyzing a comprehensive dataset containing demographic information, behavioral data, medical history, and personal opinions, this project aims to provide insights into vaccine adoption patterns. This can aid public health officials and policymakers in designing targeted interventions to improve vaccine uptake.

Detailed Description:
Vaccination is a critical public health measure, especially during pandemics. Understanding the factors that influence individuals' decisions to receive vaccines can help in formulating effective health campaigns and policies. This project focuses on predicting the adoption of two vaccines: the XYZ vaccine and the seasonal flu vaccine.

Data Description:
The dataset includes 35 features and two target variables:

Features: Demographic information (age, sex, race, education, income), behavioral factors (handwashing frequency, mask usage, social distancing), medical history (chronic conditions, healthcare worker status), and personal opinions (concerns about vaccine effectiveness and risks).
Target Variables:
xyz_vaccine: Whether the respondent received the XYZ flu vaccine (0 = No, 1 = Yes).
seasonal_vaccine: Whether the respondent received the seasonal flu vaccine (0 = No, 1 = Yes).
Methodology:
Data Collection: Load and explore the datasets containing respondents' features and vaccine uptake labels.
Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and standardize numerical features to ensure the data is clean and ready for model training.
Feature Engineering: Identify and select relevant features that contribute to the prediction of vaccine adoption.
Model Building: Construct a multi-output classification model using a Random Forest classifier to predict the likelihood of receiving the XYZ and seasonal flu vaccines.
Model Evaluation: Assess the model's performance using ROC AUC scores for each vaccine and calculate the mean ROC AUC to gauge overall predictive power.
Prediction and Submission: Apply the trained model to the test dataset and prepare a submission file with predicted probabilities for each vaccine.
Workflow:
Loading Data: Import necessary libraries and load the datasets.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Understand the data distribution and identify any anomalies or missing values.
Preprocessing Pipelines: Create pipelines to handle numerical and categorical data preprocessing.
Model Training: Split the data into training and validation sets, train the Random Forest model, and evaluate its performance.
Prediction: Generate predictions for the test dataset and prepare a submission file in the required format.
Tools and Technologies:
Python: Programming language used for data processing, modeling, and evaluation.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Scikit-learn: For preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.
CSV Module: For handling CSV files in the data pipeline.
Expected Outcomes:
Predictive Insights: Understand key factors that influence vaccine adoption and identify high-risk groups that are less likely to get vaccinated.
Public Health Impact: Provide actionable insights to health authorities to formulate strategies for improving vaccine coverage.
Technical Achievement: Demonstrate the application of advanced machine learning techniques to a real-world public health problem.
By utilizing this approach, the project aims to contribute to better health outcomes through data-driven decision-making, ultimately improving vaccine uptake and public health safety.
